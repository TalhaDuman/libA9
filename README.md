# libA9
Ai-Thinker A9(A9G) is a fairly low priced GSM module with capability of GPRS and GPS(A9G).  
This library implements several features of the module for some microcontroller families (initially for ESP32 family on ESP-IDF framework).

✅Current features:
  *  No AT commands needed
  *  Simple methods for HTTP GET/POST requests (A9/A9G does not support HTTPS)
  *  Module gets ready to make requests with only one method ".start()"
  *  Supports hard reset with power enable pin, if the power of the module is controlled via switch (ex. MOSFET)
  *  Error and info logging

⏳Planned features:
  *  Surrounding cell stations' information
  
⛔Not supported: 
  *  SMS
  *  Calls

## How to use
  1. include the header file  
     ```#include "libA9.h"```  
  2. create A9 object with your parameters (uart_num, tx_pin, rx_pin, power_enable_pin, invert_pwr_en_pin, APN)  
     ```A9 gsm = A9(..);```  
  3. power on and get the module ready for HTTP requests, returns 1 if succeeded  
     ```gsm.start();```  
  4. making the request, returns HTTP status code  
     ```gsm.http_post("http://webhook.site/d9781ab3-6cae-4f62-90df-a875d9b3e1f7","Hello world!");```  
  5. shuts the module down  
     ```gsm.stop();```
